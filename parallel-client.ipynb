There may still be a machine in the lab, but it's often not used interactively and it might be better to keep the interactive parts of a system &ndash; the notebook &ndash; on a laptop with the processor-intensive computing parts sitting on the lab server. In this chapter we'll deal with connecting a client on one machine to a compute cluster on another. [Later](parallel-async.ipynb) we'll look at an even more attractive option, where we can disconnect from the cluster and check-back later (from home? from the beach?) to see how a long-running computation is getting on.

The details of how keypairs work need not concern us &ndash; there's a good [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) if you're interested &ndash; but the important point is that you place your private key on any machine you log-in *from*, your public key on any machine you log-in *to*, and `ssh` will be able to authenticate you and secure your interactions against snooping without you having to do anything else. More importantly, programs that are `ssh`-aware &ndash; as IPython is &ndash; will also be able to interact securely and automatically through a process called \"`ssh` tunneling\" whereby they route all their communications through a secure `ssh`-protected connection. \n",
